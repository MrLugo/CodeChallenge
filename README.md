# Hacker News Best Stories API

This ASP.NET Core API retrieves the best stories from the Hacker News API based on their score.

## How to Run the Application

1. Ensure you have .NET 8.0 SDK or later installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run the following command to start the application:

   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

5. The API will be available at `https://localhost:5001` or `http://localhost:5000`.

## API Endpoint

GET /api/hackernews/best/{count}

Retrieves the top N best stories from Hacker News, where N is specified by the `count` parameter.

Example: `GET /api/hackernews/best/10` will return the top 10 best stories.

## Assumptions

1. The Hacker News API is available and functioning correctly.
2. The "best stories" endpoint provides a reasonably stable list of story IDs.
3. The individual story details don't change frequently.

## Enhancements and Changes

Given more time, the following enhancements could be made:

1. Implement more robust error handling and logging.
2. Add unit tests and integration tests to ensure reliability.
3. Implement a background service to periodically update the cache of best stories.
4. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.
5. Implement pagination for large requests.
6. Add authentication and authorization for API access.
7. Optimize the caching strategy based on actual usage patterns.
8. Implement a circuit breaker pattern for the Hacker News API calls to handle potential downtime.
9. Add monitoring and health check endpoints.
10. Containerize the application for easier deployment and scaling.
